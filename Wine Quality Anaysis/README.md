# Wine-quality-prediction
Aim of this project is to perform analysis of red wine and to check impact of various factors on quality of red wine.And lastly we will explain polynomial regression its effect and impact of degree of polynomial.Problems that can arise with respect to increase in degree of polynomial and how to encounter these problems.
# Getting Stated
In order to be able to run this project we will be needing following packages. 
- numpy
- sklearn
- pandas
- matplotlib
# Installing dependencies
```
pip install sklearn 
pip install numpy 
pip install pandas 
pip install matplotlib 
```
# Usage Example
```
First store contents of redwine in  list X
X=[fixed acidity,volatile acidity,citric acid,residual sugar,chlorides,free sulfur dioxide,total sulfurdioxide, density ,pH,sulphates,alcohol]
model.predict(X)
```
This will output a continous variable y  depending upon quality of wine.Greater the number higher the quality of wine.
